# About

I'm trying to learn three.js. There's a bunch of stuff it feels like I should know how to do, or there's tutorials I'm following, or things I'm riffing on, and I'd like a place to stash them all, so I can reference them later when I need them. This is that place. Maybe.

## Methodology

Much like my [canvas experiments](https://darby3.github.io/canvas-experiments/) repository, it's a lot of...do a thing...then copy it and modify it. Do, modify. Do, modify.

Unlike that repository I'm trying to make each sketch have a more useful title, in addition to its numbered entry, so I can find things later more easily.

## Other things

Some folders you'll find here. Some of this is hold-over content from the canvas experiments repositories. A lot of it is stolen from some specific tutorial books I'll mention here once I track down the specific sources.

> libs

Saving specific copies of three.js here so sketches don't unexpectedly break later.

> includes

I have various modules and pieces-parts I've developed or stolen that wind up in here.

> utils

A very basic utility functions object that gets used sometimes.

# three.js starters

## About

I'm trying to learn three.js. There's a bunch of stuff it feels like I should know how to do, or there's tutorials I'm following, or things I'm riffing on, and I'd like a place to stash them all, so I can reference them later when I need them. This is that place. Maybe.
